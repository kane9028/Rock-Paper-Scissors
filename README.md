# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a Rock-Paper-Scissors gaming project from The Odin Project

Below is my algorithm for this project:
Confirm with the user to start the game
    YES-start the game
    NO-Quit the game
Once the game starts, prompt the user to type in rock/paper/scissors
    if the user's input is invalid, push an error message and ask the user to input the selection again
    Once user inputs valid selection, let the computer generate a random selection from rock/paper/scissor
    Compare user's selection with computer's selection and prompt user with result 
    Store the single round result into memory prompt user for a new round
Repeat steps from lines 9-12 until 5 rounds game are completed
Prompt user with the final result and reset the game
